## The Values

*   Remember the people involved

*   Don't just try to be a good friend. Always be a good friend.
    Even in situations of hate or anger, always be a good friend. You'll never regret that

*   Stay focused. Stay true to the code
    During the week, you operate on a schedule. You have a rolling routine,
it can only change for the better. This discipline can free you to make further
informed choices.

*   People do not fully understand you
    You have a unique ability to understand them. Do not abuse it

*   Stay confident and believe the impossible. Remember you have nothing to lose

*   Use each second well. You could die any second

*   Fear getting in a rut or becoming complacent.
    There is a time and place for this, but never long. It does not happen now

*   Don't be the guy who turns 40 and hasn't lived.
    Put some value, put some companies under your belt

*   Decide quickly, improve your ability to execute. Inspire others to do the same

*   No debts. Repay immediately
    Keep this attitude and you keep control. This does not mean you cannot trust others.
Trust them with your assets if you choose, but stay away from the lending side

*   Remain a humble person. This is your weakness, it will yield dimishing returns

*   You are never the smartest person in the room

*   Physical things don't matter so do not have many possessions (unless they help you learn and grow)

*   Be an amazing partner in crime
    You've found great love, the beginning of an amazing journey.
Never forget it. Keep growing the seeds of your legacy

*   Your partner keeps you grounded. They give you strength and support when no one else will
    Together you are far stronger than you are apart. Move some fucking mountains already
